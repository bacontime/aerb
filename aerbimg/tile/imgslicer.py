# I need to make overlapping tiles for the Aerb map. 
# Why? Because the map doesn't have a simple multiple which can be looped across,
# so I need each tile able to be offset.

#img = Image.open("aerbtile.png")
img = Image.open("../AerbTileLarge.webp")

        print(area)
        cropped_img = img.crop(area)
